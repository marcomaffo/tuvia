# tuvia
Tuvia is a game I created for my bachelor thesis. Initially programmed in C# with the XNA framework, I've rewritten it first in Javascript and later fully typed in Typescript.

Tha game is a simple 2D sidescrolling shooting platformer. The game features two identical games but with a different setting. It has minigames and 3 Bosses. I developed the engine myself and I will be slowly optimizing it.

## Planned features
- Add sound
- Add a level editor

## How to play
Download the repo
-> npm i
-> npm run publish
-> open the html-file in the build-folder
